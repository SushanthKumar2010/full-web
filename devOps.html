    <h2>üöÄ What is DevOps?</h2><br>
    <p>
      DevOps is a set of practices and cultural philosophies that bring together software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to shorten the development lifecycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality.
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <h2>üéØ Why DevOps Matters</h2><br>
    <ul>
      <ul>Enhances collaboration between development and operations teams</ul>

      <ul>Improves deployment frequency and quality of software releases</ul>
      <ul>Enables a culture of continuous improvement</ul>
    </ul>
    <br><br>
    <h2>üîß Key Concepts in DevOps</h2><br>
    <ul>
      <ul><strong>Continuous Integration (CI):</strong> Automatically merging code changes into the main branch to ensure software is always in a deployable state.</ul>
      <ul><strong>Continuous Delivery (CD):</strong> Automating the release process to make software releases faster and more reliable.</ul>
      <ul><strong>Infrastructure as Code (IaC):</strong> Managing and provisioning infrastructure using code rather than manual processes.</ul>
      <ul><strong>Monitoring and Logging:</strong> Ensuring performance is continuously tracked to improve processes.</ul>
